# ✈️ Indigo-flights — Airline Feedback Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview  
Indigo-flights aims to analyze airline passenger feedback data to identify the key factors affecting **customer satisfaction**, and to provide actionable insights for improving service quality, operational efficiency, and customer loyalty. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Load and preprocess passenger feedback data  
- Explore and visualize feedback patterns and sentiment trends  
- Identify service attributes (staff behavior, punctuality, comfort, etc.) that strongly influence customer satisfaction  
- Produce insights and recommendations for airline operations and customer experience improvements  

---

## 🧠 Workflow & Methodology  

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Load dataset (e.g., CSV or survey data) containing passenger feedback details  

2. **Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
   - Clean data: handle missing values / normalize fields / encode categories  
   - Prepare data for analysis and visualization  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze distributions of feedback (e.g., ratings, categories)  
   - Visualize common issues or trends in complaints or praise  

4. **Analysis & Insight Generation**  
   - Correlate feedback attributes with overall satisfaction  
   - Identify patterns (e.g., frequent pain points, high-satisfaction aspects)  

5. **Reporting & Presentation**  
   - Summarize insights in a presentation/report  
   - Highlight actionable recommendations for airline stakeholders
